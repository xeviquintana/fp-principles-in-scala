## Recursion

**Note: If you have paid for the Certificate, please make sure you are submitting to the required assessment and not the
optional assessment. If you mistakenly use the token from the wrong assignment, your grades will not appear**

Attention: You are allowed to submit an unlimited number of times for grade purposes. Once you have submitted your
solution, you should see your grade and a feedback about your code on the Coursera website within 10 minutes.
If you want to improve your grade, just submit an improved solution. The best of all your submissions will count as the
final grade.

In this assignment, you will work with a functional representation of sets based on the mathematical notion of
characteristic functions. The goal is to gain practice with higher-order functions.

Download the recfun.zip handout archive file and extract it somewhere on your machine.

This assignment counts towards your final grade. Please refer to the Grading Policy for more details.

Do not forget to submit your work using the submit task from SBT. Please refer to the example assignment for
instructions.

### Exercise 1: Pascal's Triangle,

The following pattern of numbers is called Pascal's triangle.
```text
     1
    1 1
   1 2 1
  1 3 3 1
 1 4 6 4 1
    ...
```

The numbers at the edge of the triangle are all `1`, and each number inside the triangle is the sum of the two numbers
above it. Write a function that computes the elements of Pascal's triangle by means of a recursive process.

Do this exercise by implementing the `pascal` function in `RecFun.scala`, which takes a column `c` and a row `r`,
counting from `0` and returns the number at that spot in the triangle. For example, `pascal(0,2)=1`, `pascal(1,2)=2` and
`pascal(1,3)=3`.

```scala
def pascal(c: Int, r: Int): Int
```

### Exercise 2: Parentheses Balancing

Write a recursive function which verifies the balancing of parentheses in a string, which we represent as a `List[Char]`
not a `String`. For example, the function should return `true` for the following strings:

- (if (zero? x) max (/ 1 x))
- I told him (that it's not (yet) done). (But he wasn't listening)

The function should return `false` for the following strings:

- :-)
- ())(

The last example shows that it's not enough to verify that a string contains the same number of opening and closing
parentheses.

Do this exercise by implementing the `balance` function in `RecFun.scala`. Its signature is as follows:

```scala
def balance(chars: List[Char]): Boolean
```

There are three methods on `List[Char]` that are useful for this exercise:

- `chars.isEmpty: Boolean` returns whether a list is empty
- `chars.head: Char` returns the first element of the list
- `chars.tail: List[Char]` returns the list without the first element

**Hint**: you can define an inner function if you need to pass extra parameters to your function.

**Testing**: You can use the `toList` method to convert from a `String` to a `List[Char]`: e.g.
`"(just an) example".toList.`

### Exercise 3: Counting Change

Write a recursive function that counts how many different ways you can make change for an amount, given a list of coin
denominations. For example, there are 3 ways to give change for 4 if you have coins with denomination 1 and 2: 1+1+1+1,
1+1+2, 2+2.

Do this exercise by implementing the `countChange` function in `RecFun.scala`. This function takes an amount to change,
and a list of unique denominations for the coins. Its signature is as follows:

```scala
def countChange(money: Int, coins: List[Int]): Int
```

Once again, you can make use of functions `isEmpty`, `head` and `tail` on the list of integers coins.

**Hint**: Think of the degenerate cases. How many ways can you give change for 0 dollars? How many ways can you give
change for >0 dollars, if you have no coins?
